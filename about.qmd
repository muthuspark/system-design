        <p class="bio">
            I am Muthukrishnan, currently working as an Engineering Manager at Sanas AI Inc. I have over 16 years of experience building scalable SaaS applications from the ground up. Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working in environments ranging from small startups to established enterprises, contributing to their growth and success. As a hands-on leader, I’ve built and scaled applications that have grown from hundreds of users to millions, and I have filed five patents. These patents cover a range of technologies, from optical character recognition (OCR) to systems for cross-application walkthroughs and UI element retrieval.
