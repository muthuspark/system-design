        "Authorization is a critical aspect of security, defining *what* a user or system is allowed to do after successful authentication (verifying their identity). It's the gatekeeper that ensures only authorized entities can access specific resources and perform certain actions. This post explores various authorization models, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they are implemented.\n",

        "\n",
        "RBAC is the most widely adopted model. It assigns permissions to roles, and users are assigned to those roles. This simplifies management, as permissions are managed at the role level, rather than individually for each user.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Strengths:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Simplified management:** Easier to manage permissions for large numbers of users.\n",
        "-   **Granular control:** Roles can be customized to precisely define permissions.\n",
        "-   **Scalability:** Well-suited for large organizations and complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Weaknesses:**\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **Role explosion:** Too many roles can become difficult to manage.\n",
        "-   **Inflexible:** Difficult to handle exceptional cases that don't fit neatly into roles.\n",
        "-   **Static:** Changes to roles often require system-wide updates.\n",

        "ABAC is a more fine-grained model that uses attributes of the user, the resource, and the environment to determine access. This allows for highly dynamic and context-aware authorization decisions.\n",

        "\n",
        "OBAC is centered around the concept of ownership. The owner of a resource has full control over it, and can grant permissions to others. This is often combined with other models to provide a more robust system.\n",
