Architectural patterns are high-level design blueprints that guide the structure and organization of a software system. Choosing the right pattern impacts maintainability, scalability, and performance. This post explores many important architectural patterns, providing explanations, illustrative diagrams, and code snippets where appropriate.

## 1. Layered Pattern

The Layered pattern, also known as the n-tier architecture, organizes the system into horizontal layers, each with specific responsibilities. Common layers include presentation (UI), business logic, data access, and database. Data flows primarily vertically between layers.

**Advantages:**

-   Simple to understand and implement.
-   Clear separation of concerns.
-   Easier testing and maintenance.

**Disadvantages:**

-   Tight coupling between layers can hinder flexibility.
-   Performance can suffer due to multiple layers of communication.
-   Can become inflexible if not designed carefully.

**Diagram:**

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Presentation Layer] --> B(Business Logic Layer);
    B --> C{Data Access Layer};
    C --> D[Database];
```

**Code Example (Conceptual Python):**

``` python

def display_data(data):
    print(data)


def process_data(data):
    # ... business logic ...
    return processed_data


def get_data_from_db():
    # ... database interaction ...
    return data


data = get_data_from_db()
processed_data = process_data(data)
display_data(processed_data)
```

## 2. Microservices Architecture

This pattern decomposes the application into small, independent services that communicate with each other via lightweight mechanisms, often APIs. Each microservice focuses on a specific business function.

**Advantages:**

-   Highly scalable and fault-tolerant.
-   Independent deployments and updates.
-   Technology diversity.

**Disadvantages:**

-   Increased complexity in deployment and management.
-   Inter-service communication overhead.
-   Distributed debugging and tracing challenges.

**Diagram:**

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[User Service] --> B(Order Service);
    A --> C(Payment Service);
    B --> D(Inventory Service);
    C --> E(Notification Service);
```

## 3. Event-Driven Architecture

This pattern relies on the production, detection, and consumption of events. Components communicate asynchronously through an event bus or message queue. Changes in one part of the system trigger events that other parts react to.

**Advantages:**

-   Loose coupling between components.
-   High scalability and responsiveness.
-   Enhanced resilience.

**Disadvantages:**

-   Debugging and tracing can be complex.
-   Event ordering and consistency need careful management.

**Diagram:**

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Order Service] --> B((Event Bus));
    B --> C[Inventory Service];
    B --> D[Notification Service];
```

## 4. Model-View-Controller (MVC)

A widely used pattern for building user interfaces, MVC separates the application into three interconnected parts: Model (data and business logic), View (user interface), and Controller (handles user input and updates the model).

**Advantages:**

-   Clear separation of concerns.
-   Easier testing and maintenance.
-   Promotes code reusability.

**Disadvantages:**

-   Can become complex in large applications.
-   Not suitable for all types of applications.

**Diagram:**

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[User] --> B(Controller);
    B --> C[Model];
    C --> D(View);
    D --> B;
```

## 5. Pipe and Filter

This pattern arranges components in a linear sequence. Each component (filter) processes the input data and passes the result to the next component (pipe).

**Advantages:**

-   Easy to understand and implement.
-   Simple to add or remove components.
-   High throughput.

**Disadvantages:**

-   Limited flexibility.
-   Difficult to handle complex interactions.
-   Error handling can be challenging.

**Diagram:**

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Filter 1] --> B(Filter 2);
    B --> C(Filter 3);
    C --> D[Output];
```
