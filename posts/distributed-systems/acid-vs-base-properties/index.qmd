Modern distributed systems face a fundamental choice between strong consistency (ACID) and eventual consistency (BASE). This article explores both models, their tradeoffs, and implementation considerations.

## ACID Properties

ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) prioritizes data consistency and reliability.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Transaction] --> B[Atomicity]
    A --> C[Consistency]
    A --> D[Isolation]
    A --> E[Durability]
    B --> F[All or Nothing]
    C --> G[Valid State]
    D --> H[Concurrent Safety]
    E --> I[Permanent]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style F fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
    style H fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
    style I fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
```

The diagram illustrates the four pillars of ACID transactions:

1. Atomicity ensures operations are "all or nothing"
2. Consistency maintains valid database states
3. Isolation provides concurrent transaction safety
4. Durability guarantees permanent data storage

Each property leads to a specific guarantee, shown by the terminal nodes.

### Implementation Example

```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant N1 as Node 1
    participant N2 as Node 2
    participant N3 as Node 3
    
    C->>N1: Begin Transaction
    N1->>N2: Lock Data
    N1->>N3: Lock Data
    N2-->>N1: Locked
    N3-->>N1: Locked
    N1->>N2: Write Data
    N1->>N3: Write Data
    N2-->>N1: Success
    N3-->>N1: Success
    N1->>N2: Commit
    N1->>N3: Commit
    N1->>C: Transaction Complete
```

This sequence diagram shows a distributed ACID transaction:

1. Client initiates transaction with Node 1
2. Node 1 acquires locks on Node 2 and 3
3. After confirmation, data is written to all nodes
4. Two-phase commit ensures consistency
5. Client receives completion confirmation only after all nodes commit

## BASE Properties

BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventually consistent) prioritizes availability and partition tolerance.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[BASE Model] --> B[Basic Availability]
    A --> C[Soft State]
    A --> D[Eventual Consistency]
    B --> E[System Remains Available]
    C --> F[State May Change]
    D --> G[Consistency Over Time]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
    style F fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
    style G fill:#ddf,stroke:#333
```

Diagram shows BASE characteristics:

1. Basic Availability ensures system operation
2. Soft State allows temporary inconsistencies
3. Eventual Consistency guarantees convergence over time

Each property leads to a specific system behavior shown in the terminal nodes.

### Implementation Example

```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Client] --> B[Node 1]
    A --> C[Node 2]
    B --> D[(Datastore Local)]
    C --> E[(Datastore Local)]
    D -.-> F[Eventual Consistency]
    E -.-> F
    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

This diagram illustrates a BASE system:

1. Clients can write to any node
2. Each node has a local datastore
3. Dotted lines show eventual consistency mechanism
4. Data synchronizes across nodes over time

## Implementation Patterns

### Two-Phase Commit (2PC)
```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Coordinator
    participant P1 as Participant 1
    participant P2 as Participant 2
    
    C->>P1: Prepare
    C->>P2: Prepare
    P1-->>C: Ready
    P2-->>C: Ready
    C->>P1: Commit
    C->>P2: Commit
```

Diagram shows two-phase commit protocol:

1. Prepare phase: Coordinator asks participants to prepare
2. Commit phase: After all ready, coordinator commits
3. Ensures atomic transaction across distributed system

### Three-Phase Commit (3PC)
```{mermaid}
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Coordinator
    participant P1 as Participant 1
    participant P2 as Participant 2
    
    C->>P1: CanCommit?
    C->>P2: CanCommit?
    P1-->>C: Yes
    P2-->>C: Yes
    C->>P1: PreCommit
    C->>P2: PreCommit
    P1-->>C: Ready
    P2-->>C: Ready
    C->>P1: DoCommit
    C->>P2: DoCommit
```

Diagram shows three-phase commit:

1. CanCommit: Initial feasibility check
2. PreCommit: Preparation phase
3. DoCommit: Final commit phase
Adds timeout safety over 2PC

### Event Sourcing Pattern
```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Event] --> B[Event Store]
    B --> C[Projections]
    C --> D[Query Model]
    C --> E[Analytics]
    style B fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

Diagram shows event-based architecture:

1. Events are primary source of truth
2. Event Store maintains complete history
3. Projections create different views
4. Supports both querying and analytics

### CQRS Pattern
```{mermaid}
graph LR
    A[Commands] --> B[Write Model]
    C[Queries] --> D[Read Model]
    B --> E[Event Bus]
    E --> D
    style E fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
```

Diagram shows Command Query Responsibility Segregation:

1. Separates write and read models
2. Commands handle data modifications
3. Queries access read-optimized views
4. Event bus synchronizes models

## Hybrid Architecture
```{mermaid}
graph TB
    A[Application] --> B[Critical Operations]
    A --> C[Non-Critical Operations]
    B --> D[(ACID Database)]
    C --> E[(BASE Storage)]
    D -.-> F[Sync Service]
    E -.-> F
    style F fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

Diagram shows practical combination of ACID and BASE:

1. Critical operations use ACID database
2. Non-critical operations use BASE storage
3. Sync service maintains consistency
4. Balances reliability and scalability
